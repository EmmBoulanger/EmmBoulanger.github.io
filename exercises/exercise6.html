        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>After entering UMass Amherst as a 
            astronomy major, Emma quickly found 
            her home amongst the creative witing
             program instead, after taking the
              introduction course. Continuing 
              her studies, Emma found herself 
              drawn to the technical writing 
              field as well, pursuing the 
              Professional Writing and 
              Technical Communications 
              certificate. Her intention is to 
              turn her focus to persuing an 
              internship in the techincal 
              writing field and apply her 
              knowledge of both the creative 
              and technical crafts.
            </p>
            <p></p>
        <p>When Emma isn't working or studying, she is a proud member 
            of the Marching Band (during the fall season), reading,
             and learning new activities with friends.</p>
